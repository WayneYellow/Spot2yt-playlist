# Spot2yt-playlist
I want to make a tool that allows users to convert Spotify playlists to YouTube playlists.

Procedure:
1. User input Spotify playlist
    - Ask the user to input their Spotify playlist URL
    - Check the input is correct

2. Choose search type: **MV** or **Music** or **Lyrics** first

3. Show preview playlist
    - Display a preview of the YouTube playlist before proceeding.
    - Include options for the user to **delete** specific songs or **choose different versions** if available.

4. User input collaboration link of YT playlist
    - Ask the user to input the **collaboration link** of the YouTube playlist where they want to add the songs
    - Provide clear instructions on how to obtain this link from YouTube

5. Add songs into YT playlist
