# Spot2yt-playlist
I want to make a tool that allows users to convert Spotify playlists to YouTube playlists.

Procedure:
1. User input Spotify playlist
    - Ask the user to input their Spotify playlist URL.
    - Check the input is correct.

2. Choose search type: MV or Music first

3. Show preview playlist
    - Display a preview of the YouTube playlist before proceeding.
    - Include options for the user to delete specific songs or choose different versions if available.

5. Add songs into YT playlist
